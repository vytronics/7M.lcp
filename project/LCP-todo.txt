Configure in script
SG5N.INH.IND
SG5N.INH.SET.CTL
SG5N.INH.RESET.CTL

There is only one stop and callon ctl per track at an interlocking. Registered mulitple tags with the same item name. Make sure this works ok. There should not be an issue since the software was designed to allow multiple tags to register same items.

TRACK inhibits
P1-INHIBIT.SET.CTL
P1-INHIBIT.RESET.CTL
